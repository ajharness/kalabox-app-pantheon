# Kalabox Pantheon App
## Overview

By default Kalabox can pull apps from and push apps to Pantheon... but this is much more than basic push/pull integration. Kalabox will build out a local Pantheon environment for each app. This means `solr`, `redis`, `ssl` and `terminus` all work just like they do on Pantheon. You can also use `drush`, `wp-cli`, `ssl` and toggle `php` version. YAY!

## Creating and starting a Pantheon app

This will spin up a Pantheon-on-Kalabox environment, set up relevant tools like `terminus`, `drush` and `wp-cli` and pull down the site and environment that you choose.

```bash
cd ~/dir/i/want/my/app/to/live (usually ~/Desktop/apps)
kbox create pantheon # and follow the prompts
kbox start
```

Or you can run non-interactively

```bash
cd ~/dir/i/want/my/app/to/live (usually ~/Desktop/apps)
kbox create pantheon -- --email=me@me.com --password=**** --site=pantheon-site --env=pantheon-env --name=myApp
kbox start
```

**NOTE:** You **must** issue your `kbox create pantheon` from somewhere inside your `HOME` directory.
**NOTE:** This 'create' functionality actually comes from the core kalabox-pantheon plugin.

## Tools and working with your code

You can run various Pantheon-helpful tools like terminus. To see a list of all the things run `kbox` from inside of your app directory.

```bash
Usage: kbox <command> [-- <options>]

## Pulling from Pantheon

You can refresh your local code and even your database and files by running `kbox pull` from inside of your Pantheon app.

```
kbox pull -- -h

  -v, --verbose  Use verbose output.                                   [boolean]
  -m, --message  Tell us about your change                              [string]
  --database     Push DB to specific env. Options are dev and none      [string]
  --files        Push files to a spefic env. Options are dev and none   [string]

## Edge

To bypass varnish and directly hit the appserver you can go to appserver.appname.kbox.

## SSL

You can use `https` by just typing in `https://myapp.kbox` in your browser. We self-sign the certs so you will need to allow this in your browser.

## SOLR

Apache Solr comes in each local Pantheon environment. You can use it the exact same way as you do on Pantheon.

https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/sites/apache-solr/

## Redis

Just follow the same instructions from Pantheon to get redis to work locally.

https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/sites/redis-as-a-caching-backend/

The TL;DR for Drupal 7 (on php 5.3) here is

1. Install the [redis module](http://drupal.org/project/redis) (only 2.x supported)
2. Use this code snippet in settings.php

```php
// All Pantheon Environments.
if (defined('PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT')) {
  // Use Redis for caching.
  $conf['redis_client_interface'] = 'PhpRedis';
  $conf['cache_backends'][] = 'sites/all/modules/redis/redis.autoload.inc';
  $conf['cache_default_class'] = 'Redis_Cache';
  $conf['cache_prefix'] = array('default' => 'pantheon-redis');
  // Do not use Redis for cache_form (no performance difference).
  $conf['cache_class_cache_form'] = 'DrupalDatabaseCache';
  // Use Redis for Drupal locks (semaphore).
  $conf['lock_inc'] = 'sites/all/modules/redis/redis.lock.inc';
}
```

## Xdebug

xdebug is set up on your php appserver. Here is an example SublimeText 2 config (similar settings have been tested on Codebug, Eclipse, and other debugging tools). Note that you may need to launch it in the browser the first time using XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1 as a query parameter (ex: http://my-app.kbox/some-page?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1). If breakpoints aren't working in your debugger, try inserting xdebug_break() in your code.

```json
{
  "folders":
  [
    {
      "path": "/local/path/to/my/code"
    }
  ],
  "settings":
  {
    "xdebug":
    {
      "max_children": 32,
      "max_depth": 16,
      "pretty_output": true,
      "path_mapping":
      {
        "/code/": "/local/path/to/my/code/"
      },
      "port": 9000,
      "url": "http://mysite.kbox/"
    }
  }
}
```
