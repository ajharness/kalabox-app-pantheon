#
# Cli plugin task definition
#
# If the cli plugin is enabled in kalabox.yml then this file will be
# used used to specify the tooling commands that this app can run.
#
# Each object defines a specific task. When a task is implemnented correctly
# it should show up when you run `kbox` inside of your app. T
#
# Tasks can use any of the services in kalabox-compose.yml, kalabox-cli.yml or
# other compose files you load with your app.
#
# Here is a general description of a task object
#
# commandname:
#
#   service: [service] - The service on which to run the command.
#
#   stripfirst: [true|false] - If your commandname key is different from the
#     entrypoint you might want to strip the commandname aka running `kgit git`
#     vs `kgit`.
#
#   entrypoint: [string|array] - The binary to use. This will default to the
#     entrypoint of the service.
#
#   description: [string] - A human readable description that will show up
#     on the CLI.
#
#   precmdopts: [string] - A string of options to insert between the entrypoint
#     and the command the user types.
#
#   postcmdopts: [string] - A string to append to the user entered command.
#
#
# NOTE: You will want to make sure your services correctly set relevant options
# such as sharing config files or the working directory.
#

#
# Adds a git command to your Pantheon app.
#
# You can still use your local git if you want. We also use a git wrapper called
# `kgit` to handle sharing files correctly.
#
# By default your git commands will use your Pantheon ssh key and git user/email
# will be based on your Pantheon info.
#
# This will run relative to your webroot.
#
git:
  service: cli
  stripfirst: true
  entrypoint: kgit

#
# Adds a rsync command to your Pantheon app.
#
# This will run relative to your webroot.

# This will drop you into a bash shell on your appserver
#

#
# Adds a terminus command to your pantheon app.
#
# This will share the session that lives on your host at
# ~/.kalabox/pantheon/session/EMAIL. It will also share the exact same
# configuration as your appserver. It will also use your pantheon ssh key.
#
# Commands will be run relative to your webroot.

#
# Adds a drush 8 command to your pantheon app.
#
# This will share the drush config that lives in config/drush relative to your
# app root. So you can drop custom aliases and command files in there. Drush
# will also use your pantheon SSH key by default.
#
# Commands will be run relative to your webroot.
